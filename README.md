## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![github-header-image (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba284da2-164a-4306-8896-aee70f42e19a)

I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Malaya. Currently, I'm in my third year of the program. I am passionate about building innovative software solutions and am always eager to learn new technologies.




ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on building Android mobile apps, including a calculator and Visa App 2.0, to enhance my development skills. I'm passionate about improving my coding by taking on challenging projects and experimenting with new technologies. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and constantly pushing myself to grow as a developer.
  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in depth algorithms such as backtracking, 1D and 2D dynamic programming. Also, I'm learning html and react to create websites.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mobile applications and websites, especially those focused on productivity tools, health tech, or innovative problem-solving platforms.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing user authentication and authorization in web applications, specifically learn how to effectively manage user sessions, handle token-based authentication, and implement role-based access control.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to software development, including mobile app development, algorithms, and data structures. I'm also happy to discuss project ideas, coding best practices, or tips for improving your programming skills!
