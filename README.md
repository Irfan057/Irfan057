## About me

I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Malaya. Currently, I'm in my third year of the program. I am passionate about building innovative software solutions and am always eager to learn new technologies.




ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on building Android mobile apps, including a calculator and Visa App 2.0, to enhance my development skills. I'm passionate about improving my coding by taking on challenging projects and experimenting with new technologies. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and constantly pushing myself to grow as a developer.
  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in depth algorithms such as backtracking, 1D and 2D dynamic programming. Also, I'm learning html and react to create websites.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mobile applications and websites, especially those focused on productivity tools, health tech, or innovative problem-solving platforms.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing user authentication and authorization in web applications, specifically learn how to effectively manage user sessions, handle token-based authentication, and implement role-based access control.
